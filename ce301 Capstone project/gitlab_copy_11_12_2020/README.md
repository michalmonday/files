#### The [challenge week](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_borowski_michal/-/tree/master/challenge%20week) directory contains:  
* [Project introduction](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_borowski_michal/-/blob/master/challenge%20week/Project%20introduction.docx) Word document, which includes write-ups about objectives, background reading and project management  
* [features_documentation.md](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_borowski_michal/-/blob/master/challenge%20week/features_documentation.md) file, which presents technical advancements made up to final day of the challenge week (Friday 16/10/2020)  

#### The [interim interview](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_borowski_michal/-/tree/master/interim%20interview) directory contains:  
* [features_documentation.md](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_borowski_michal/-/blob/master/interim%20interview/features_documentation.md) file, which is updated version of challenge week equivalent, demonstrating implemented functionality of the program up to interim interview (week 11)   
* [implementation_report.md](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_borowski_michal/-/blob/master/interim%20interview/implementation_report.md) file, which describes how the program was implemented, what technology and design patterns were used  
* [project_management.md](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_borowski_michal/-/blob/master/interim%20interview/project_management.md) file, where I addressed planning, organisation, risk management and use of project management tools like Jira and Gitlab  

## Background 
It's a program created for CE301 Capstone Project module, based on the [Project Choices Database proposal](https://moodle.essex.ac.uk/mod/data/view.php?d=490&perpage=30&search=a+tool+for+teaching&sort=0&order=ASC&advanced=0&filter=1&f_3666=&f_3667=&u_ln=&f_3671=&f_3672=) by Dr. Michael Sanderson:  
>The aim of this project is to implement a tool to assist with the teaching of graph algorithms such as those taught in CE204.  
>  
>It should provide a graphical display of step-by-step implementation of the algorithms with accompanying descriptive text. This should be offered at various levels of abstraction (e.g. for Kruskal's algorithm a version showing the connection sets and a more abstract version that uses the concept of not forming a cycle). It should be able to work on arbitrary graphs (i.e. the descriptions should not be based on a particular graph).  
>  
>Ideally there should also be a graphical user interface that allows the user to create graphs by adding nodes at points on the display and creating edges to connect them, allowing the user's chosen graph to be used to demonstrate the algorithm.  
>  
>The tool could be written as a web application using JavaScript or a stand-alone Java program.
